However, Precision and Recall are often trades off each other. Improving precision might highly reduces Recall rate. Vise versa, increasing recall rates very likely reduces precision. \n- Thus, the overall performance of a classifier, summed over all possible thresholds, is given by ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics). \n- Also ROC can handle the scenario when the data is imbalanced.\n\n#### What is ROC curve? \n- Is used to examined how well your classifier can separate positive and negative data points. \n- And is used to identify the best threshold for separating positive and negative examples. \n- #TODO graph / formula\n\n#### How to use ROC? \n- To use ROC, classify need to output scores or probability. \n- ROC curve is created by plotting True positive rate (TPR) against False positive rate (FPR) at various threshold. \n- Formula or graph (#TODO)\n\n#### What is AUC (Area Under the Curve)?\n- It is the area under the ROC. \n- Best model has AUC equals to 1.0. The better the model, the higher its AUC score.\n- # TODO graph / model\n\n\n\n#### F1 score: \n- After picking the best model, Then we can use F1 score at find out which threshold has the highest F1 score. \n- F1 score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall.\n- Formula: \n$$ F_1 = 2 \\* \\frac{\\text{precision * recall}}{\\text{precision + recall}} $$\n\n\n#### Precision: \n- the measure of the correctly identified positive cases from all the predicted positive cases. \n- Formula: $$\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positive}}{\\text{True Positive + False Positive}} $$\n\n#### Recall: \n- the measure of the correctly identified positive cases from all the actual positive cases. \n- Formula: $$ \\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{True Positive}}{\\text{True Positive + False Negative}} $$\n\n\nsources: \n- https://medium.com/swlh/recall-precision-f1-roc-auc-and-everything-542aedf322b9\n- https://machinelearningmastery.com/roc-curves-and-precision-recall-curves-for-imbalanced-classification/\n- https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/accuracy-vs-f1-score-6258237beca2"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data Ingestion"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Join Datasets"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Split Train/Validation/Test"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# __Section 2__ - Algorithm Explanation"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[""],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[""],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# __Section 3__ - EDA & Challenges"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[""],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[""],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# __Section 4__ - Algorithm Implementation"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[""],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[""],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# __Section 5__ - Course Concepts"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[""],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[""],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":22}],"metadata":{"name":"ucb-w261-sp2021-team25","notebookId":785654973958885},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
