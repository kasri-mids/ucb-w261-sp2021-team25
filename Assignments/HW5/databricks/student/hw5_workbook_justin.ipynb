What are the nodes/edges in this dataset? Is the graph you describe 'directed' or 'undirected'? What would the average \"in-degree\" of a node mean in the context of your example? \n\n* __b) short response:__ Other than their size/scale, what makes graphs uniquely challenging to work with in the map-reduce paradigm? *(__HINT__: Do not respond in terms of any specific algorithm. Think in terms of the nature of the graph datastructure itself).*\n\n* __c) short response:__ Briefly describe Dijskra's algorithm (goal/approach).

At what expense?"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Q1 Student Answers:\n> __a)__ A classic example of a graph dataset is a set of HTML pages with HTTP links (e.g. the web). The nodes are the pages, usually identified by a URL, and the edges are the HTTP links in one page, pointing to another. This graph is directed, and the in-degree of a node is the total number of links in other pages pointing to it.\n\n> __b)__ One thing that can make graphs challenging to work with is that there are not necessarily natural partitionings of them. In other words, paths an algorigthm may take through the graph might make it impossible to assign some nodes to an individual partition of the dataset.\n\n> __c)__ Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in the graph, assuming there are no negative length edges. The algorithm starts at a source node, and enqueues neighbors into a priority queue, with the shortest distance being highest priority. It expands nodes on the queue, only adding nodes that were unvisited or updating previously visited nodes with a longer than current path. The priority queue makes this approach hard to parallelize.\n\n> __d)__ It gets around it by performing expansion of all possible paths through the graph, instead of being greedy and aiming for the shortest paths first. The expense is we process more nodes than we would otherwise, but the benefit is that we can parallelize the exploration."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Question 2: Representing Graphs \n\nIn class you saw examples of adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations of graphs.

A Markov Chain is a discrete-time stochastic process. The stochastic matrix has a principal left eigen vector corresponding to its largest eigen value which is one. A Markov chain's probability distribution over its states may be viewed as a probability vector. This steady state probability for a state is the PageRank of the corresponding webpage.

As usual, we seek to design our computation so that as much work as possible can be done using the contents of a single record. In the case of PageRank, we'll need each record to include a node, its list of neighbors and its (current) rank. In this question you'll initialize the graph by creating a record for each dangling node and by setting the initial rank to 1/N for all nodes. \n\n__`NOTE:`__ Your solution should _not_ hard code \\\\(N\\\\).\n\n### Q7 Tasks:\n* __a) short response:__ What is \\\\(N\\\\)?
