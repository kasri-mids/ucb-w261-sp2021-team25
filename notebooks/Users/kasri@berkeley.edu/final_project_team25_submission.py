# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You should refine the question formulation based on the general task description youâ€™ve been given, ie, predicting flight delays. This should include some discussion of why this is an important task from a business perspective, who the stakeholders are, etc.. Some literature review will be helpful to figure out how this problem is being solved now, and the State Of The Art (SOTA) in this domain. Introduce the goal of your analysis. What questions will you seek to answer, why do people perform this kind of analysis on this kind of data? Preview what level of performance your model would need to achieve to be practically useful. Discuss evaluation metrics.

# MAGIC ##  Overview
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This notebook is a summary notebook of our team's effort to predict flight delays. Predicting flight delays is no small feat. From a high level, [airline delays cost ~ $33B](https://www.faa.gov/data_research/aviation_data_statistics/media/cost_delay_estimates.pdf). Not only that, approximately 19% of flights were delayed in 2019 [and approximately 1.5% of the flights were cancelled](https://www.mit.edu/~hamsa/pubs/GopalakrishnanBalakrishnanATM2017.pdf). 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC While this problem is one that can definitely be continuously dug into and improved upon, we hope that some of the ideas and approaches outlined in this notebook can be applied to improving prediction down the line. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We have featured some papers here that have helped us inform our approach to this problem.
# MAGIC [Some comment on state of the art - ask Karthik] [review]
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Evaluation metrics
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC A brief comment: a common approach to evaluating most ML based problems is to look at problems from a precision recall approach. Emphasizing precision will position our target towards emphasizing false positive whereas recall will position our target against false negatives. Accidentally predicting a flight may be delayed (false positive) cause someone to show up later than expected to a flight. Conversely, failing to predict a delayed flight may cause someone to show up earlier than needed to an airport.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC There are many people in the economic system who are affected by the accuracy of flight predictions - flight passengers, airport and airline employees, as well as general shareholders of airline companies. Ultimately, it is incumbent on the customer (namely, airline companies) to accurately measure the dollar cost of delayed flights from a FP, FN perspective, and which one to subsequently optimize for. For the purposes of this notebook, we will stick to optimizing on our models based on a F1 score to have a good balance between precision & recall.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The formula for an F beta score is below:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC $$F_{\beta} = (1 + \beta^{2}) \frac{precision \cdot recall}{(\beta^{2} \cdot precision) + recall} $$
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For reference, utilizing a F0.5 score would produce an F score more geared towards precision while still factoring in recall. On the other hand, utilizing a F2 score would bias our results more towards recall as opposed to precision.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As part of the project, we were given access to a dataset consisting of US flights from the years 2015-2019. We generally worked with data in SQL format, using the databricks tables as that made it relatively easy to checkpoint our datasets and seemed less cumbersome than working with pyspark. We loaded the flight data into a table and looked at some basic stats.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC SELECT 'All' as Year, count(*)
# MAGIC FROM group25.airlines_main
# MAGIC UNION
# MAGIC SELECT YEAR, count(*)
# MAGIC FROM group25.airlines_main
# MAGIC GROUP BY 1
# MAGIC ORDER BY 1;

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The airlines data is comprised of approximately 31M flights, and the number of flights seems to be increasing year-over-year. We suspect if we had more recent data, we would have seen a dip starting in 2020 as lockdowns for the Covid pandemic began in the US. We realized up front that we would run into challenges with leackage, which we will discuss more in depth later. For now, we will exclude 2019 from EDA, as that will be our holdout set for test.

# MAGIC ## Schema & Meaning

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC DESCRIBE group25.airlines_main

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Looking at the schema for the table gave us some initial sense of which data might be continuous (e.g. often, but not always, `int` fields) versus categorical (`string` fields).
# MAGIC We used [the provided codebook](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FGJ) to better understand the fields in the table. One of the first challenges we faced was getting data into UTC format, since the codebook indicated that times in the original dataset were local times relative to the airport. In order to convert these into UTC, we first had to find additional data telling us what timezone the airport was in. For this, we found [Airport codes and timezones](https://openflights.org/data.html) from the OpenFlights project.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC This data was joined to the flights data and combined with the data in the flights field to generate a new table with UTC timings. This was particularly necesary for joining with the weather datasets, which will be discussed in a section of its own later in this notebook.

# MAGIC ## Exploration Process

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Our primary goal for EDA was to understand which features might be useful as predictors for flight delays. We wrote some simple code to visualize either categorical or continuous variables against the DEP_DEL15 column, which indicates whether a flight was delayed more than 15 minutes. We created a couple of simple methods to plot categorical and continuous variables in a uniform way. We'll visualize a few interesting examples below, with a more complete set to be found in the EDA notebook.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Looking at this chart helps us identify features that are highly-colinear and probably would not make sense to include together in our models. For example, `ACTUAL_ELAPSED_TIME` and `AIR_TIME` have a correlation coefficient of 0.99 and therfore probably do not both need to be included in set of model features we use.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Further, we see some interesting relationships to the outcome variable, for example that distance and delay times are not highly correlated, which might suggest that the length of a flight is not particularly helpful in understanding the chances it might be delayed. We can look more closely at that relationship using our plotting methods 

# COMMAND ----------

plot_cont_vs_delay('DISTANCE')

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC On the otherhand, many of the features in the dataset are not actually useful for prediction because they would not be available at the time of prediciton. Obviously, we cannot include arrival time in predicting departure delays. So many of these features were ruled out on that basis.

# MAGIC ## Time Based Features

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We looked at the daily aggregate fraction of 15-minute delayed flights and noticed some very clear patterns. The winter holiday season has a clear spike, and there also is an increase in the summer months, corresponding to the US vacation season. One possibility this suggested to us was running a time series model (e.g. Seasonal ARIMA) and using the output as a feature. This fell to low in our priority list to address, so we leave that for further work.

# COMMAND ----------

daily_delay_frac= spark.sql("SELECT * FROM group25.daily_delay_fraction WHERE year(day) < 2019 ORDER BY day").toPandas()
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(20,7))
sns.lineplot(y='fraction_delayed', x = 'day', data=daily_delay_frac)
ax.set(xlabel="Day", ylabel="Fraction Delayed")
plt.suptitle('Fraction of Flights Delayed per Day')

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC There is an interesting pattern in the impact of local and UTC hours on delays. For the continuous version of delays, we end up with a clear gap in the distribution that shows up in the strip plot (on the left) below, and is consistent across hours. Additionally we see that a larger percentage of flights are delayed past 15 minutes in the local evening hours, between 7 and 10PM.

# COMMAND ----------

plot_cat_vs_delay('DEP_LOCAL_HOUR', sample_size = 100_000)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Somewhat surprisingly, we did not observe as much signal coming from the day of week. It seems that time of day is more predictive of delays than day of week:

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## Time
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Motivation
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC A common trope for time is that it is a precious resource, and that is doubly true for the field of flight delay prediction. The concept of time was a topic we discussed heavily when tackling this problem - more specifically, the granularity. For instance, will knowing the information for the previous year help us make an informed decision for whether the next flight will be delayed? Possibly, we also wanted to have more granular data as well, since we believed that there would be much better granularity. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC On the other hand, will knowing the flight data in 5 minute increments and binning the data as such lead to better predictions? That is certainly possible, but may also lead to some additional processing for complicated pipelined features.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Ultimately, we settled on an hourly granularity. While this was partially based on consensus and intuition, it is a nice round unit of time that is widely understood and helps to make this analysis easier to interpret. However, more granular binnings of time, such as by 5 minute increments, could possibly yield better results.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In terms of how far in advance we would have this information, we decided to try and gather a set of features for each airport 2 hours in advance. For instance, what was the weather 2 hours prior to the scheduled takeoff? What was the status of delays and divered flights at the outgoing airport?
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The challenge with this approach was that not all of our data was formatted correctly. While the weather data was given in a standardized UTC format, the flight data was not. Ensuring that our dataset utilized consistent time formats across the board was important to predicting delays 2 hours out. The datetime format is critical for several niche problems with joining on data from 2 hours prior. For instance, what if you want flight data 2 hours prior to a 1 am flight? You cannot join simply on FL_Date and a hour granularity. Furthermore, once you start working with timezones and daylight savings, things get especially complicated. A good rule of thumb for sanity is to generate all of your datetime formats first as upstream as possible, before applying any interval functions. Any downstream code or engineered features benefit immensely from this approach.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In terms of grabbing the time zone data per airport, we utilized the OpenFlights data. In order to ensure proper matching with our dataset, we utilized timezone data from [OpenFlights](https://openflights.org/data.html).
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Spark has some limited inbuilt capabilities when it comes to handling timezones, so we leveraged more commonly used datetime python libraries. The issue with this is that you have to run your data through a Spark UDF to leverage the datetime library at scale. While doing this is not the most performant Spark operation, it did work with the scale of data we had in a reasonable amount of time.

For the purpose of brevity, we will not highlight every column in the dataset, however, a more detailed description for each column can be found in the following document. https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly/doc/isd-format-document.pdf
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We will cover one of the main fields that we utilized in our modeling process below.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Example of how a field was parsed
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We will walk through the field AA1 as an example for how features were mined in the NOAA dataset. All of the other columns we mined for used a similar format, so highlighting one instance should also inform how the other fields were parsed. The field AA1 is actually a comma delimited field. This applies to most, if not all columns in the ISD dataset. An observation for AA1 may look like the following.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __Sample Field:__ 04,9996,4,2
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Based on the ISD format document provided by NOAA, the definition for the field can be interpreted as the following
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * First delimited field: LIQUID-PRECIPITATION period quantity
# MAGIC * Second delimited field: LIQUID-PRECIPITATION depth dimension
# MAGIC * Third delimited field: LIQUID-PRECIPITATION condition code
# MAGIC * Fourth delimited field: LIQUID-PRECIPITATION quality code
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Using the definitions present in the NOAA dataset, we filtered down the dataset on the 3rd and 4th delimited fields (condition code, quality code), which give information about the quality about the particular record. For instance, a quality field with the value "2" is denoted as being suspect according to the ISD document. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Once the appropriate records were filtered out, we then aggregated the data on a callsign (airport), date, and hourly basis for the respective field (AA1), and then took the average at each aggregation point.

# MAGIC Airline flight data forms a natural graph in some obvious ways. Airports are clearly connected by flights, so we can consider airports as verticies and flights between them as edges. We could make the vertices more complex by addtionally segmenting them by airline or time frame. We could also invert the graph, treat vertices as edges that connect an incoming flight to an outgoing flight. These approaches can be mixed in many ways, some of which may be computationally prohibitive.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For any of these graphs, we might compute the centrality of its vertices using various scores. PageRank is one such score, and it tells us what proportion time a random surfer might spend at a given node if they were doing an infinite walk. In the airline cone

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Hypothesis & background
# MAGIC - When we first approached the flight delay problem, we thought that inbound flights and outbound flights should be great features for predicting the flights delay or not. 
# MAGIC - The hypothesis behind that is busier airports could be more likely to have flights delay due to capacity constraints, tighter resources, and consequent congestion. All these reasons are likely to cause flights delay.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### 1st Iteration: 
# MAGIC - So we compute related inbounds and outbound features: 
# MAGIC   - For outbound features, we calculated:
# MAGIC     - outbound_counts /airport/flight date/departure local hour
# MAGIC     - diverted outbound_counts /airport/flight date/departure local hour
# MAGIC     - delay outbound_counts /airport/flight date/departure local hour
# MAGIC   - For inbound features, we calculated:
# MAGIC     - inbound_counts /airport/flight date/arr local hour
# MAGIC     - diverted inbound_counts /airport/flight date/arr local hour
# MAGIC     - delay inbound_counts /airport/flight date/arr local hour
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Problem
# MAGIC However, when we plotted out the features against delay vs non-delay, we noticed that there wasnâ€™t much difference for these inbound and outbound related features between delayed flights and non-delayed flights. Thus, these features were not quite useful at a first glance.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Analysis of Problem
# MAGIC Later, we further hypothesized that it could be the problem with normalization. The underlying reason is that each airport has different capacities. For instance, 100 outbound flights could be close to the maximum capacity of airportA but the same number could just be close to half of the capacity of airportB (which could have a much bigger capacity than AirportA). 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Another problem with raw statistics of inbound and outbound count is that airports might have increased maximum capacity due to renovation during the years between 2015-2020. So an absolute raw number would not take into account whether an airport is busy or not. An airport might have increased its capacity by say 20% after a renovation, such that 100 outbound/hour could be an amount that could cause congestion and delay flights before renovation, yet the same number might be an easy task for the same airport. And we didnâ€™t take into account of this with the raw statistics.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC So we went to search around for data that could tell us about each airport's capacity each year. However, we didn't find an ideal dataset.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Solution: Max Median
# MAGIC So finally, we decided to use max median inbound and max median outbound to normalize the raw inbound and outbound data.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The idea and reason behind that is we want to find a number that is somewhat approximate maximum capacity under the condition we donâ€™t have any information of renovation. Here are some reasons:
# MAGIC Maximum hourly outbound/inbound number might be squeezed any statistics that happened before the renovation to a very small number. Thus we might get lots of incorrectly scaled number. 
# MAGIC Median hourly outbound/inbound might not approximate maximum capacity. 
# MAGIC Thus, to balance, we picked the maximum median, which is the maximum among the medians outbound/inbound for each hour for each airport.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### How to calculate Maximum Median
# MAGIC How to compute Maximum Median which is used for normalization? 
# MAGIC - Step1: we comute the houlry outbound/inbound counts for each airporlt/flight_date/hour.
# MAGIC - Step2: we compute the median inbound/outbound number for each airport at each hour (Say median inbound for all 10am-11am periods for airportA). 
# MAGIC - Step3: we find the maximum among all the medians for that particular airport.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Code:
# MAGIC code for computing max_median_inbound & max_median_outbound, please refer to here: https://dbc-c4580dc0-018b.cloud.databricks.com/?o=8229810859276230#notebook/439895120630397/command/439895120630403
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Data Leakage: 
# MAGIC - For preventing data-leakage, we calculate the median for inbound counts and outbound bounds with data ONLY in 2015-2017, which is the same period as our training dataset. 
# MAGIC - The reason we use only training data (data in 2015-2017) to calculate median is because our model shouldn't know any data from the future. 
# MAGIC - We calculate the maximum median based on data from 2015-2017, and we use that to normalize all the data from 2015-2020. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### 2nd Iteration: 
# MAGIC - So in the 2nd iteration, we normalized the sets of features in the 1st iteration. We calculate the normalized inbound/outbound related features by dividing the raw statistics by max_median for that corresponding airport
# MAGIC - For outbound features, we calculated:
# MAGIC   - normalized_outbound_counts = outbound_counts / max_median_outbound
# MAGIC   - normalized_diverted_outbound_counts = diverted_outbound_counts / max_median_outbound
# MAGIC   - normalized_delay_outbound_counts = delay_outbound_counts / max_median_outbound
# MAGIC - For inbound features, we calculated:
# MAGIC   - normalized_inbound_counts = inbound_counts / max_median_inbound
# MAGIC   - normalized_diverted inbound_counts = diverted_inbound_counts / max_median_inbound
# MAGIC   - normalized_delay inbound_counts = delay_inbound_counts / max_median_inbound
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Time Series of Inbound & Outbound Features
# MAGIC - To account for the time series-aspect of the airline data, we also calculate something we called as lag features. 
# MAGIC - These features ends like feature_name_xH (for example: NORMALIZED_OUTBOUND_COUNT_2H)
# MAGIC - For instance: for a flight that departs at 11am at AirportA that has NORMALIZED_OUTBOUND_COUNT_2H = 20, means that normalized outbound counts from 8am-9am at airportA (1 hour timeframe, 2 hours prior the departure time) .
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Below are some example lag features for inbound & outbound features. We done this for all 3 sets of inbound/outbound features: inbound/outbound, diverted inbound/outobund, delay inbound/outbound. 
# MAGIC     - OUTBOUND_COUNT_2H
# MAGIC     - OUTBOUND_COUNT_3H
# MAGIC     - OUTBOUND_COUNT_4H
# MAGIC     - OUTBOUND_COUNT_5H
# MAGIC     - OUTBOUND_COUNT_6H
# MAGIC     - NORMALIZED_OUTBOUND_COUNT_2H
# MAGIC     - NORMALIZED_OUTBOUND_COUNT_3H

# MAGIC ## Null Value Imputations
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Our team largely used Spark SQL to join data together from various tables. Unfortunately, Sparkâ€™s MLLib will not work if the features will null values. Because of this, addressing nulls is extremely important for effective model results. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Our ML pipeline approach involved generating features, and creating separate tables, then joining them back to the main airlines table via left joins. This allowed our team to work effectively in parallel to use a divide and conquer approach to generate interesting features. However, when joining the tables back together, a key issue we faced with these joins is null values.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We decided to impute the values differently, based on whether or not the feature was categorical or continuous.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Continuous**
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For all features, loop through &calculate the median for each grouping below:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC   1. Call_Sign, Month, Hour
# MAGIC   2. Call_Sign, Month
# MAGIC   3. Call_Sign
# MAGIC   4. Overall Median
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For each row, if the feature does not exist, use group 1. If group 1 does not exist, use group 2. If group 2 does not exist, use group 3. If group 3 does not exist, use group 4.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Categorical**
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The approach for this is much simpler. If the value is null, impute a 0 for null features.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC A diagram highlighting our approach can be found below. The underlying code for this can be found in the Join notebook linked in the Companion notebook section.

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Why Prevent Data Leakage
# MAGIC Data leakage is a critical part of ensuring our Machine Learning pipeline is as robust as possible. It is important to prevent data leakage when training the model because we want our model to predict well when it meets unseen data in a real world scenario. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC To ensure that our model doesn't predict delays/not-delay based on future information, we handle data with below approaches. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Split Train/Test/Validation
# MAGIC The data that is given is from 2015-2019. A key concern of ours was how to prevent leakage, or val or test datasets leaking into our test dataset. To set up our data pipeline to prevent leakage, we set up train, test, and validation training sets:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Train - 01/01/2015 - 12/31/2017
# MAGIC - Validation - 01/01/2018 - 12/31/2018
# MAGIC - Test - 01/01/2019 - 12/31/2019
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Inbound & Outbound Statistics
# MAGIC - For the Inbound and Outbound related features, to prevent data leakage, so we connect the flights 
# MAGIC - To prevent data-leakage, when calculating the median for inbound counts and outbound bounds, we only use data in 2015-2017 to calculate the median.
# MAGIC - The reason we use only training data (data in 2015-2017) to calculate median is because our model shouldn't know any data from the future. 
# MAGIC - So we calulate median based on data from 2015-2017, and used that to normalized all the data from 2015-2020. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Time Series Aspect of Inbound & Outbound Features
# MAGIC - To account for the time series-aspect of the airline data, we also calculate something we called as lag features. 
# MAGIC - These features ends like faeture_name_xH (for example: NORMALIZED_OUTBOUND_COUNT_2H)
# MAGIC - For example NORMALIZED_OUTBOUND_COUNT_2H for a flight departs at 11am at AirportA, that means that normalized outbound counts from 8am-9am (1 hour interval, 2 hours prior the departure time) at airpotA.
# MAGIC - Same theory applies for the inbound features. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ### Weather Data
# MAGIC - To prevent data leakage, we only use weather data 2 hour prior the departure time of a particular flight
# MAGIC - For example, if a flight's departure date is 1/1/2016 10am, then we only use weather feature up until 1/1/2016 8am to predict whether its delay

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We split the data into train, validation and test sets. We used data between 2015-2017 for train, 2018 for validation and 2019 for test. For all models discussed here, we use 5-fold cross validation on the train set. We perform a parameter grid search on the train set and evaluate the candidate models on the validation set. Since our dataset is imbalanced, i.e., the number of delays is much smaller than the number of undelayed fights, \\( \approx 4 \\) times smaller, we use the sampling techniques discussed below to address the imbalance. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC All sampling experiments are only conducted on the train data. We chose 1,000,000 train records for training on a wide class of ML algorithms.
# MAGIC * No over/under sampling: This is the baseline case with regards to sampling. No modifications are done to the train dataset.
# MAGIC * Class-Weighted Sampling: Here, we do not modify the underlying train dataset but scale the losses to accomodate the imbalance.
# MAGIC * Bootstrapping: We duplicate the minority class so that we are left with similar proportions of delay/no-delay records.

We compared various models using the \\( F_{0.5} \\) score. We take the viewpoint of the Airport/Airline that is looking to have more precision in the predictions. Any decisions made on the delay predictions are likely to have cascading consequences in the origin airport as well as the destination.

# MAGIC ## Toy Problem for Logistic Regression

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In order to illustrate the inner workings of one of the algorithms we are working with, we will be implementing a toy example of logistic regression using gradient descent. Unlike linear regression, which uses a linear combination of terms, logistic regression applies the sigmoid function to the typical regression equation. In other words,
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC $$f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\theta^{T}x}} $$
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Similarly, unlike linear regression, which uses squared loss, logistic regression uses log-loss cost function. The Logloss function is below:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC $$ J(\theta) = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} -y_{i} \times log(h_{\theta}(x_{i})) + (1 - y_{i}) \times log(1-h_{\theta}(x_{i}))$$
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Below is the code to implement logistic regression for a very small subset of data for KORD (Chicago), for  the first quarter of 2015. I will use 3 columns - dep_del15 (dependent variable), with 2 sample scaled features.
